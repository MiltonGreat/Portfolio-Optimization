# Portfolio Optimization

This repository shows projects that deal with portfolio management, trading strategies, risk analysis, fraud detection, and ethical investing. 

### 1. Portfolio Optimization & Asset Allocation

**Dataset:** Stock Portfolio Optimization

**Description:** This dataset contains historical stock price data, enabling the application of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and efficient frontier analysis to optimize portfolio returns while managing risk.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Optimal Portfolio Construction:** Applied Markowitz Portfolio Theory to allocate assets efficiently.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** Estimated expected returns and risk profiles for different portfolio allocations.
- **Risk Management Strategies:** Compared Equal Weight vs. Risk-Parity portfolios to assess diversification benefits.

### 2. Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis

**Dataset:** Global Financial Crises Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains macroeconomic indicators and financial market data, making it useful for evaluating financial institution resilience under economic downturns.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Macroeconomic Shock Simulation:** Modeled recession scenarios and inflation spikes to assess portfolio risk.
- **Credit Risk Impact Analysis:** Studied loan default probabilities under extreme economic conditions.
- **Risk Measurement:** Applied Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall modeling to quantify potential losses.

### 3. Alternative Data & Sentiment Analysis in Finance

**Dataset:** Financial News Headlines

**Description:** This dataset contains financial news articles and stock price movements, allowing the exploration of alternative data sources for market predictions.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Sentiment Analysis & Market Signals:** Applied NLP models to classify news as bullish, bearish, or neutral.
- **News Impact on Stock Prices:** Conducted event-based analysis to measure stock reactions to breaking news.
- **News-Driven Trading Strategies:** Built LSTM models for predicting price movements based on sentiment scores.

### 4. Financial Fraud Detection Beyond Anomalies

**Dataset:** Synthetic Financial Transactions

**Description:** This dataset contains synthetic banking transaction records, providing insights into network-based fraud and financial crime detection.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Graph-Based Fraud Detection:** Used Node2Vec and GraphSAGE embeddings to model fraud networks.
- **Coordinated Fraud Ring Analysis:** Detected collusive behaviors in banking transactions.
- **Ensemble Learning for Risk Scoring:** Combined Isolation Forests and XGBoost to improve fraud detection accuracy.

### 5. Explainable AI in Finance (XAI)

**Dataset:** Home Credit Default Risk

**Description:** This dataset contains loan application data, making it useful for studying interpretability in credit risk modeling.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **SHAP-Based Credit Scoring:** Used SHAP values to explain key factors influencing loan approvals.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyzed how income, credit history, and employment status impact loan risk.
- **LIME for Model Interpretability:** Applied LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to validate credit risk predictions.

### 6. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Investing

**Dataset:** ESG Risk Ratings Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk scores for publicly traded companies, enabling the analysis of sustainable investing trends.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **ESG Risk Score Prediction:** Built regression models to forecast ESG scores for companies.
- **NLP for ESG Insights:** Used earnings call transcripts to extract ESG-related sentiment using natural language processing.
