# Portfolio Optimization

This repository shows projects that deal with portfolio management, trading strategies, risk analysis, fraud detection, and ethical investing. 

### 1. Portfolio Optimization & Asset Allocation

**Dataset:** Stock Portfolio Optimization

**Description:** This dataset contains historical stock price data, enabling the application of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) and efficient frontier analysis to optimize portfolio returns while managing risk.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[Monte Carlo Simulations:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Monte-Carlo-Simulations.git)** Estimated expected returns and risk profiles for different portfolio allocations.
- **[Risk Management Strategies:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Risk-Management-Strategies.git)** Compared Equal Weight vs. Risk-Parity portfolios to assess diversification benefits.

### 2. Stress Testing & Scenario Analysis

**Dataset:** Global Financial Crises Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains macroeconomic indicators and financial market data, making it useful for evaluating financial institution resilience under economic downturns.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[Macroeconomic Shock Simulation:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Macroeconomic-Shock-Simulation.git)** Modeled recession scenarios and inflation spikes to assess portfolio risk.
- **[Credit Risk Impact Analysis:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Credit-Risk-Impact-Analysis.git)** Studied loan default probabilities under extreme economic conditions.
- **[Risk Measurement:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Risk-Measurement.git)** Applied Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall modeling to quantify potential losses.

### 3. Alternative Data & Sentiment Analysis in Finance

**Dataset:** Financial News Headlines

**Description:** This dataset contains financial news articles and stock price movements, allowing the exploration of alternative data sources for market predictions.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Sentiment Analysis & Market Signals:** Applied NLP models to classify news as bullish, bearish, or neutral.
- **News Impact on Stock Prices:** Conducted event-based analysis to measure stock reactions to breaking news.

### 4. Financial Fraud Detection Beyond Anomalies

**Dataset:** Synthetic Financial Transactions

**Description:** This dataset contains synthetic banking transaction records, providing insights into network-based fraud and financial crime detection.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **Graph-Based Fraud Detection:** Used Node2Vec and GraphSAGE embeddings to model fraud networks.
- **Coordinated Fraud Ring Analysis:** Detected collusive behaviors in banking transactions.
- **Ensemble Learning for Risk Scoring:** Combined Isolation Forests and XGBoost to improve fraud detection accuracy.

### 5. Explainable AI in Finance (XAI)

**Dataset:** Home Credit Default Risk

**Description:** This dataset contains loan application data, making it useful for studying interpretability in credit risk modeling.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **[SHAP-Based Credit Scoring:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/SHAP-Based-Credit-Scoring.git)** Used SHAP values to explain key factors influencing loan approvals.
- **[Feature Importance Analysis:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Feature-Importance-Analysis.git)** Analyzed how income, credit history, and employment status impact loan risk.
- **[LIME for Model Interpretability:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/LIME-Model-Interpretability.git)** Applied LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to validate credit risk predictions.
- **[Explainability in Credit Decisions:](https://github.com/MiltonGreat/Explainability-in-Credit-Decisions.git)** Used SHAP and LIME to identify which features most contributed to biased outcomes.

### 6. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Investing

**Dataset:** ESG Risk Ratings Dataset

**Description:** This dataset contains ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk scores for publicly traded companies, enabling the analysis of sustainable investing trends.

**What I Did in the Project:**

- **ESG Risk Score Prediction:** Built regression models to forecast ESG scores for companies.
